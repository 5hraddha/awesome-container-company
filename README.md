## Technologies and Standards Used
**The technologies that have been used are:**

1. ReactJS
2. Tailwind CSS
3. Framer Motion
4. Node.js
5. Express Framework (for development)
6. AWS Simple Email Service (SES)

### ![ReactJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
- **ReactJS** is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications.
- It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

### ![Tailwind CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-38B2AC?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)
- **Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. 
- It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

### ![Framer Motion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framer-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=framer&logoColor=blue)
- **Framer Motion** is production-ready animation library for React on the web that makes creating animations easy. 
- Its simplified API helps us abstract the complexities behind animations and allows us to create animations with ease.

### ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white)
- **Node** (or more formally *Node.js*) is an *open-source*, *cross-platform* runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. 
- *Node. js* is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. 
- It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services.

### ![ExpressJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=white)
- **Express** is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks. 
- It provides mechanisms to:
  - Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
  - Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
  - Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
  - Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.

### ![AWS SES](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon_AWS-FF9900?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazonaws&logoColor=white)
- **Amazon Simple Email Service** (SES) is a cost-effective, flexible, and scalable email service that enables developers to send mail from within any application.
- You can configure Amazon SES quickly to support several email use cases, including transactional, marketing, or mass email communications.
